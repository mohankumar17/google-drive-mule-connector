== Types
[[Reconnection]]
=== Reconnection

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Fails Deployment a| Boolean | When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment will fail if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  | 
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> | The reconnection strategy to use |  | 
|======================

[[reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often (in ms) to reconnect |  | 
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts to make |  | 
|======================

[[reconnect-forever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often (in ms) to reconnect |  | 
|======================

[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  | 
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  | 
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT. |  | 
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  | 
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  | 
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL | Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL", which will throw a NoSuchElementException, "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT", which will block by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available, or WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which will create a new Mule instance and return it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it will block for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException will be thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it will block indefinitely. |  | 
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL | Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. The possible values are: INITIALISE_NONE (will not load any components into the pool on startup), INITIALISE_ONE (will load one initial component into the pool on startup), or INITIALISE_ALL (will load all components in the pool on startup) |  | 
| Disabled a| Boolean | Whether pooling should be disabled |  |
